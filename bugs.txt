This file contains the bugs I fixed in the project.

Course.java:

- Line 50 & 55, function getCourseLocation() and getInstructorName(): Fixed problem of wrong return value.
- Line 34 & 48, function enrollStudent() and dropStudent(): Added if statement to check if add/drop is applicable,
  return false if it's not, and return true if it is.
- Line 100, function isCourseFull(): Changed > to <= for correctly check if course is full.


Department.java:

- Line 37, function getNumberOfMajors(): delete the negative sign before return value.

- Line 62, function addPersonToMajor() --> increaseMajorNumber(): change function name by javadoc comments.
- Line 69, function dropPersonFromMajor() --> decreaseMajorNumber(): change function name by javadoc comments;
  add if statement to check if the major number is greater than 0.

  a "\n" at the beginning.
